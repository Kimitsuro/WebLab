                from the novel. The protagonist's weapon is a staff, which is based on the

                from the novel. The staff can extend and shrink in size during combat. The three staff stances, which are the smash stance, the pillar stance, and the thrust stance, provide versatility in fights. The combat mechanics involve resource management. Focus can be accumulated by landing light attacks, executing well-timed dodges, and other means. A focus point is gained when the meter for focus is filled up. These points can be used to initiate a varied combo, chained to light attacks, or to charge a heavy attack on its own. Stamina is depleted by sprinting, dodging, and attacking.

                ascends to 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood" title="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a>. 
                However, he ultimately rejects life in the Celestial Court and chooses to revel in the simple joys of life on

                instead. The Court grows mistrustful of his choice to forgo the life above and sends an army led by 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_Shen" title="Erlang Shen">Erlang</a> to force him to submit to the Court. Sun Wukong duels Erlang, but he is incapacitated by the circlet that binds him to the Court and is sealed in stone. Before he is sealed, Sun Wukong is split into six 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indriya" title="Indriya">relics</a>, 
                each one corresponding to one of his six senses, which are scattered all across China. Over the next few centuries, the monkeys of Mount Huaguo would send out young warriors to recover the relics to revive Sun Wukong. One such monkey, referred to as the Destined One, sets out on his quest to find the relics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First relic: He first heads to the burnt down ruins of Guanyin Temple and recovers the first relic, Sun Wukong's "Craving Eyes", by defeating 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heifeng_Guai" title="Heifeng Guai">Heifeng Guai</a>, 
                    who apologizes and claims he was forced by the Court to oppose the Destined One.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second relic: The Destined One then heads to Yellow Wind Ridge where he defeats the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Journey_to_the_West_characters#Yellow_Wind_Demon" title="List of Journey to the West characters">Yellow Wind Sage</a> 
                    and recovers the severed head of the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Journey_to_the_West_characters#Buddhist_pantheon" title="List of Journey to the West characters">Bodhisattva Lingji</a>, 
                    which was used to store the second relic, Wukong's "Fuming Ears". As an appreciative gesture, Lingji hands it over to the Destined One.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third relic: The Destined One continues his journey to the

                    where he frees

                    from imprisonment and they both defeat 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Journey_to_the_West_characters#Yellow_Brows_Great_King" title="List of Journey to the West characters">Yellowbrow</a>. 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya" title="Maitreya">Maitreya</a> 
                    proceeds to thank them for defeating Yellowbrow, who stole his artifacts as well as the third relic, the "Hubris Nose" which he then gives to the Destined One.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fourth relic: The Destined One and Bajie then arrive at the lair of the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Journey_to_the_West_characters#Spider_Demons_and_Hundred-Eyed_Demon_Lord" title="List of Journey to the West characters">Spider Demons</a> 
                    to find the fourth relic, but Bajie is captured by the matriarch, the Violet Spider, who plans to marry and devour him for having "ruined" her centuries earlier (it is implied he fathered her youngest daughter after a tryst with her). The Destined One rescues Bajie and battles both the Violet Spider and the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Journey_to_the_West_characters#Spider_Demons_and_Hundred-Eyed_Demon_Lord" title="List of Journey to the West characters">Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master</a>, 
                    resulting in their deaths and the acquisition of the fourth relic, the "Envious Tongue".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fifth relic: The Destined One and Bajie continue to the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_Mountains" title="Flaming Mountains">Flaming Mountains</a>, 
                    where they find the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Boy" title="Red Boy">Red Boy</a> 
                    attempting to steal the fifth relic from the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Demon_King" title="Bull Demon King">Bull Demon King</a>. 
                    The Destined One defeats Red Boy, who then commits suicide to avoid the humiliation of defeat. This enables the Destined One to take possession of the fifth relic, Sun Wukong's "Grieved Body". At this point it is explained that, rather than willingly dividing his power into six relics, Sun Wukong's body was butchered by Erlang, who shared his powerful remains between the yaoguai kings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sixth relic: With five of the relics now in possession, the Destined One and Bajie return to Mount Huaguo to find the sixth and final relic. On the way, they find that 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruyi_Jingu_Bang" title="Ruyi Jingu Bang">Sun Wukong's old weapon</a>, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour" title="Armour">armour</a> 
                    and cloud have been hidden in the region, thus they decide to recover them before the Court does. They reach the summit of Mount Huaguo and enter the stone, discovering that it contains Sun Wukong's lingering memories. There, the Old Monkey reveals the truth: what was to be the sixth relic, Wukong's 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manas_(early_Buddhism)" title="Manas (early Buddhism)">Mind</a>, 
                    was lost when he died, as it is its nature. Thus, the original Sun Wukong was never to be revived and instead, the journey was meant for the Destined One to be forged into someone worthy of Wukong's powers and mantle, becoming in a sense the sixth relic, the "Freed Mind", himself and the new Sun Wukong.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Endings</h4>
            <p>
                In order to achieve reincarnation, the Destined One is forced to battle the stone body of Sun Wukong, who has no mind and no soul. Upon the defeat of Wukong's stone body, there exists two endings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the Destined One did not fulfill any of the optional requirements for other endings, he fails to inherit Sun Wukong's legacy. The Old Monkey puts the circlet, which bound Sun Wukong to the Celestial Court, on the Destined One who seemingly remains trapped inside the stone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the Destined One defeated Erlang Shen in an optional boss fight prior to the final battle, he successfully inherits Sun Wukong's memories and refuses to wear the circlet, preventing himself from being bound to the Celestial Court.
